# Angelo's dotfiles

![Dotfiles preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finalangel/dotfiles/master/preview.png)

ü§ó &nbsp;These dotfiles help me to set up and maintain my macOS or Linux installations.
They intend to automate the installation and update process of, well,
everything. Feel free to explore, copy and re-use the code to your liking.

- üìñ &nbsp;Read my [blog post](https://angelo.dini.dev/blog/dotfiles/) about these files

## Installation

üí• &nbsp;**Warning**: Please fork and review the code first, before giving these dotfiles
a try. In theory, they can be installed on an existing system as well, but a
fresh installation is recommended. Use at your own risk.

**macOS notes**: Make sure to install the Xcode Command Line Tools by running
`xcode-select --install` first, then log into iCloud and the Apple App Store.

The following command will install the dotfiles into `~/.dotfiles` and runs the
installer automatically ü§ñ:

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finalangel/dotfiles/master/bootstrap)"

ü§î &nbsp;Yeah that's it, really, I think...

## The `dot` command

üëâ &nbsp;Once installed, use the following command to manage the dotfiles:

    $ dotfiles --help
    Usage: dotfiles [options]

    Options:
      -e, --edit     Edit dotfiles
      -g, --go       Go to dotfiles directory
      -h, --help     Show help
      -i, --install  Runs installer
      -u, --update   Runs updater

## What's included

Except for `utils/` and `scripts/` every folder is its self-containing
**topic/** providing an `install` and `update` script. You can easily disable
individual **topics/** by commenting the lines in `scripts/`. On top of that:

- every `aliases.zsh`, `paths.zsh` and `functions.zsh` file in **topics/** is automatically loaded
- every `.symlink` file in **topics/** will be mapped to `~/.[filename]`
- everything in the `bin/` folder gets automatically added to your `$PATH`

The following package flavours are installed:

- [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) with nice custom font management
- [Git with GPG signing](https://gnupg.org/) enabled
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with cask and mas
- [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) to backup application settings
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [Node with NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) manager
- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- [Python with pyenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and virtualenv
- [Starship](https://starship.rs/) üöÄ
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and plugins

## Contributions

üêõ &nbsp;Feel free to send me pull requests if something is misconfigured or could be
enhanced upon. These are very personal, but if they work for others as well,
the more, the merrier. I generally still want to improve on:

- Adding [tests](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles/tree/master/test) would be nice :)
