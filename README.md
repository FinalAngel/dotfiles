My personal dotfiles for macOS and Linux 👨‍💻

## Component setup

In general every folder is self-contained, meaning they can be installed independently. Though this script borrows concepts from `holman's dotfiles <https://github.com/holman/dotfiles>`\_ for ease of use.

- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any file ending in \*.symlink gets symlinked into your \$HOME. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get symlinked in when you run script/bootstrap.
